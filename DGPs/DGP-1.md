# DGP-1: The Dock Governance Proposal Process

## What is a DGP?
DGP stands for Dock Governance Proposal. A DGP outlines a detailed proposal meant for review by the Dock community and Core Developers about any changes to the Dock network maintenance and development. Every DGP must provide a clear and focused specification of the proposed change including the rationale behind the change. The author of each DGP is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## DGP Rationale
This process is meant to be the first of several steps towards embracing decentralized governance for the betterment of the Dock network and community. We expect DGPs to be a driving force for community input on development decisions that are shaping the future of the Dock network.

By taking this first step towards a more transparent decision process, the Dock Core Developers seek to give DOCK holders a more impactful role in the evolution of the Dock network.

## DGP Work Flow
Parties involved in this process are you, the _DGP Author_, the _Dock Core Developers_, and all remaining _Dock Network Voters_.

Status changes made by the Dock Core Developers are detailed as such:

* **Active** - Some informational or process DGPs such as this (DGP-1) and all newly approved DGPs awaiting network vote.
* **Rejected** - A DGP that has been rejected by the Dock Core Developers.
* **Passed** - A DGP that has passed a vote by Dock Network Voters.
* **Failed** - A DGP that has failed to pass a vote by Dock Network Voters.

The overall workflow for this process is:

### 1. Pre-proposal 
Before submitting a DGP, you should seek feedback on your proposal by sharing it with the Dock community. We recommend you share your proposal idea(s) in:

  * The [Community category] ([https://community.dock.io/c/dockcomm](https://community.dock.io/c/dockcomm)) in the Dock forum
  * In [Issues] ([https://github.com/getdock/voting/issues](https://github.com/getdock/voting/issues)) of the [voting repo] ([https://github.com/getdock/voting](https://github.com/getdock/voting))

In order to maximize the potential for submitting a successful proposal, be respectful to your fellow community members by following the guidelines in our [Community FAQ] ([https://community.dock.io/faq](https://community.dock.io/faq)) and use constructive feedback you receive to revise your proposal prior to submission.

### 2. Draft submission
Once you have collaborated with the Dock community for constructive feedback, you can write a draft DGP as a pull request to the voting repo using the template provided and a temporary name.

  * If agreeable, a Dock Core Developer will assign the DGP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the DGP) and merge your pull request.
  * Any rejected DGP will not be given a number and the pull request will be closed with a detailed comment of the rationale behind the decision. In some cases, you may be invited to resubmit after making material changes based on constructive feedback by the community or Core Developers.

### 3. Dock Network Vote
All DGPs that have been approved and assigned a number will be shared prominently with the Dock community and then put to a vote. The outcome of each vote is subject to the terms and quorum requirements of our voting contract.

## History
This document was derived heavily from [Aragon’s AGP-1](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md) written by John Light, borrowed from [Ethereum’s EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) written by Martin Becze and Hudson Jameson, which itself was derived from [Bitcoin's BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki) written by Amir Taaki, which in turn was derived from [Python's PEP-0001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/). In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although each text was written by their respective authors, they are not responsible for its use in the Dock Governance Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Dock or the DGP. Please direct all comments to the Dock Core Developers.
